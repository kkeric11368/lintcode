//Given an array of integers and an integer k, 
//you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

//Example
//Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
/Output: 2

// The idea behind this approach is as follows: 
// If the cumulative sum(represented by sum[i] for sum upto i^{th} index) upto two indices is the same, 
// the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero. 
// Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum upto two indices, 
// say i and j is at a difference of k i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = k, 
// the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.
//
// Based on these thoughts, we make use of a hashmap map 
// which is used to store the cumulative sum upto all the indices possible 
// along with the number of times the same sum occurs. 
// We store the data in the form: (sum_i, number of occurences of sum_i). 
// We traverse over the array nums and keep on finding the cumulative sum. 
// Every time we encounter a new sum, we make a new entry in the hashmap corresponding to that sum. 
// If the same sum occurs again, we increment the count corresponding to that sum in the hashmap. 
// Further, for every sum encountered, 
// we also determine the number of times the sum sum-k has occured already, 
// since it will determine the number of times a subarray with sum k has occured upto the current index. 
// We increment the countcount by the same amount.
//
// After the complete array has been traversed, the countcount gives the required result.
